About Background-Job-Runner

The Background-Job-Runner project is a Laravel-based application designed to run PHP classes and methods in the background without relying solely on Laravel's native queue system. This solution provides custom handling of background processes, including error handling, retries, logging, and security validation.
Key Features

    Custom Background Job Processing: Execute PHP classes and methods in the background with custom handling.
    Error Handling & Retries: Mechanisms to handle errors and retry jobs.
    Logging & Security Validation: Logs job details and validates security to block unauthorized jobs.
    Priority & Delay Options: Supports priority levels and delayed execution for jobs.

7.Usage

To queue a background job, call the runBackgroundJob function with the necessary parameters. For example:

runBackgroundJob('App\Jobs\ExampleJob', 'handle', ['param1', 'param2'], $priority = 1, $delay = 0);

8.Testing Unauthorized Jobs

To test calling runBackgroundJob with an unauthorized class or method, wrap it in a try-catch block to catch any exceptions:

try {
    runBackgroundJob('App\Jobs\UnauthorizedJob', 'unauthorizedMethod');
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    echo "Security check passed: Unauthorized job was blocked. Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}

9.Web Dashboard (Optional)

The project includes an optional web-based dashboard for managing background jobs:

    View active background jobs, status, and logs.
    Retry or cancel jobs from the dashboard.
    Access the dashboard at /dashboard/jobs (requires admin privileges).
